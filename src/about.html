            <p>Hi! My name's Meghan and I'm a trans fem software engineer and love to write code that helps people. I decided on these programs, not only to promote <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>, but also because I wanted to create a suite of web servers to create an opposition against the growing draw towards centralized services. With these programs I wanted to empower people to use many of the types of services they know and love, but in a package that respects their privacy, are easy to use, and can be self-hosted and integrate well together.</p>
